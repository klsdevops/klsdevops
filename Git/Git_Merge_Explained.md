# **Git Merge:**

* The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.
* Git merge will combine multiple sequences of commits into one unified history.
* In the most frequent use cases, git merge is used to combine two branches.
* During merge conflicts, Git will need user intervention to continue. 

**Preparing to merge:** Before performing a merge there are a couple of preparation steps to take to ensure the merge goes smoothly.

**Confirm the receiving branch:** Execute git log to ensure that HEAD is pointing to the correct merge-receiving branch. 

  ```
     $ git checkout main
     $ git log --oneline
  ```
  
**Fetch latest remote commits:** Make sure the receiving branch and the merging branch are up-to-date with the latest remote changes.

```$ git pull_ OR _git fetch```
  
**Merging:** A merge can be initiated by executing git merge where  is the name of the branch that will be merged into the receiving branch.

```$ git merge feature_branch```

## Fast Forward Merge
* A fast-forward merge can occur when there is a linear path from the current branch tip to the target branch.
* Instead of “actually” merging the branches, all Git has to do to integrate the histories is move (i.e., “fast forward”) the current branch tip up to the target branch tip.

### CREATE A NEW FILE AND COMMIT TO THE REPO

### CREATE A NEW FEATURE BRANCH "new-feature" 

klsdevops@DESKTOP-IPOC5HT MINGW64 ~/Desktop/test (master)
$ git checkout -b new-feature master
Switched to a new branch 'new-feature'

### UPDATE A FILE IN THE NEW FEATURE BRANCH AND COMMIT

klsdevops@DESKTOP-IPOC5HT MINGW64 ~/Desktop/test (new-feature)
$ vi test

klsdevops@DESKTOP-IPOC5HT MINGW64 ~/Desktop/test (new-feature)
$ git add .
warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in test.
The file will have its original line endings in your working directory

klsdevops@DESKTOP-IPOC5HT MINGW64 ~/Desktop/test (new-feature)
$ git commit -m "second commit"
[new-feature afaf55f] second commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

$ git branch

klsdevops@DESKTOP-IPOC5HT MINGW64 ~/Desktop/test (new-feature)
$ git status
On branch new-feature
nothing to commit, working tree clean

### CHECK THE COMMIT HISTORY. YOU COULD SEE A NEW COMMIT HASH HAS BEEN CREATED AND THE HEAD OF FEATURE BRANCH IS POINTING TO IT

klsdevops@DESKTOP-IPOC5HT MINGW64 ~/Desktop/test (new-feature)
$ git log --oneline
afaf55f (HEAD -> new-feature) second commit
cc9cab9 (master) first commit

### CHECKOUT TO "master" BRANCH AND CHECK THE COMMIT HISTORY. YOU COULD SEE ONLY ONE COMMIT & HEAD OF MASTER IS POINTING TO IT.

klsdevops@DESKTOP-IPOC5HT MINGW64 ~/Desktop/test (new-feature)
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'

klsdevops@DESKTOP-IPOC5HT MINGW64 ~/Desktop/test (master)
$ git log --oneline
cc9cab9 (HEAD -> master) first commit

### MERGE THE FEATURE BRANCH TO MASTER BRANCH.

klsdevops@DESKTOP-IPOC5HT MINGW64 ~/Desktop/test (master)
$ git merge new-feature
Updating cc9cab9..afaf55f
Fast-forward
 test | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

### CHECK THE COMMIT HISTORY

klsdevops@DESKTOP-IPOC5HT MINGW64 ~/Desktop/test (master)
$ git log --oneline
afaf55f (HEAD -> master, new-feature) second commit
cc9cab9 first commit

### YOU COULD SEE THE HEAD HAS POINTED TO THE SAME COMMIT "afaf55f" AND BOTH MASTER AND FEATURE BRANCHES ARE POINTING TO THE SAME COMMIT.
### IN EFFECT, IT'S JUST AS FAST FORWARDING (MOVING) THE HEAD TO THE LATEST COMMIT OF THE TARGET BRANCH.

### NOW, DELETE THE FEATURE BRANCH AS IT IS ALREADY MERGED TO THE MASTER.

klsdevops@DESKTOP-IPOC5HT MINGW64 ~/Desktop/test (master)
$ git branch -d new-feature
Deleted branch new-feature (was afaf55f).

klsdevops@DESKTOP-IPOC5HT MINGW64 ~/Desktop/test (master)
$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean

### CHECK THE COMMIT TO SEE THE HEAD OF MASTER IS POINTING TO THE LATEST COMMIT

klsdevops@DESKTOP-IPOC5HT MINGW64 ~/Desktop/test (master)
$ git log --oneline
afaf55f (HEAD -> master) second commit
cc9cab9 first commit

```

## 3-Way Merge

* A 3-way merges use a dedicated commit to tie together the two histories.
* Git uses three commits to generate the merge commit: the two branch tips and their common ancestor.
* This is a common scenario for large features or when several developers are working on a project simultaneously.
