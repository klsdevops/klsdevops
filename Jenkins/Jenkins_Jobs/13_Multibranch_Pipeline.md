# Multibranch Pipeline

The **Multibranch Pipeline** project type enables you to implement different Jenkinsfiles for different branches of the same project. In a Multibranch Pipeline project, Jenkins automatically discovers, manages and executes Pipelines for branches which contain a _Jenkinsfile_ in source control.

This eliminates the need for manual Pipeline creation and management.

# Why did we move to Multibranch Pipeline?

Before moving to Pipeline, we used to create a separate job for each environment (dev, qa, uat and production) which was time taking. The number of jobs kept on increasing which became really hard to manage. Pipeline jobs made complete sense in our case because we had a standardized branching strategy in our version control, with each branch mapping to each environment. In most cases, the code was consistent across branches controlled by variables, which led to creating a generic _Jenkinsfile_.

# What are benefits of Jenkinsâ€™ multi-branch pipeline?

  - **Pipeline as Code:** We are tracking every change to the CI/CD workflow by maintaining it with application code in version control.
  - **Reducing the number of jobs:** Earlier we used to create a job for each branch, as the number of applications increased the number of jobs also increased. By creating Multibranch Pipeline the number of jobs reduced by 75 percent. This is a huge drop, and our Jenkins box looks a lot cleaner now.
  - **CI part of the Pipeline:** Before moving to pipelines, we used to have a dedicated CI job for each application. Now CI is a part of the one pipeline job. We could use conditions(eg; when) in our Jenkinsfile to achieve this.
  - **Better Troubleshooting when the Job fails:** Since the whole Pipeline is divided into multiple stages, whenever there is an issue you can pin-point at which stage the error happened and the troubleshooting becomes more focused.
  - **Backup of Pipeline:** We have a backup of our pipeline in our repository, which can be easily restored in case of a crash.

# Create a "Develop" branch from the "Master" branch of the repository

# To create a multibranch pipeline, click on "new item" and select "Multibranch Pipeline" from the options & click OK

# Add a Branch Source (for example, Git) and enter the location of the repository.

Save the Multibranch Pipeline project.

Upon Save, Jenkins automatically scans the designated repository and creates appropriate items for each branch in the repository which contains a _Jenkinsfile_.

## You could see it has created two pipelines for the branches "Master" & "Develop"

## If you click on each pipeline, you could see the details of job executed

## Ideally, your master code will have Production Environment details & Develop code will have Development environment details & the deployment happens to those respective servers.

# To enable autoscan for multibranch pipeline

* Install the plugin "Multibranch-scan-webhook-trigger"

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90503660/136668874-dd2e5af7-6103-4ce8-963c-0f04aabc9dfb.png)

After installing this plugin, you will see a new area for "Scan Multibranch triggers"

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90503660/136669066-4b78bc89-e401-4ded-8807-a34871bc6673.png)

## The selected line should be copied & used with the same token in the github settings while creating the webhook

# Add a webhook for the multiscan triggers

It will show you a tick mark.

# Make some updates in code & push the changes to remote

You could see some automatic jobs has been triggered

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90503660/136669445-4abf530b-4c34-4f36-8f40-bf89e830ba89.png)

# Now if you want to see some automatic scans when we create a new branch, 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90503660/136669748-70354747-c413-4bcf-bc0b-6ac9e32e3883.png)

## Now you could see an automatic trigger has initiated & a new pipeline for UAT has been created

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90503660/136669755-96b009ec-4fd6-4b5d-8b66-b3f855f8a56c.png)

# What happens if there's no Jenkinsfile in a branch ?

If there's no Jenkinsfile, it will not create any pipeline for that particular branch.

We can test it by removing Jenkins file from one branch & see,

For eg; we will remove Jenkinsfile from the newly created UAT branch,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90503660/136669966-f5aa02a2-e803-48de-baf8-52f479181789.png)

You could see Jenkinsfile has disappeared from Remote UAT branch

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90503660/136669983-60512863-666a-4fb6-a535-5f898a9244e1.png)

When you check the multibranch pipeline, you could notice the "UAT" pipeline has been removed automatically

# Usecases

## Now if the developer make changes & commit only to the Develop branch, then it will trigger only the Develop pipeline & do a deployment only to the development server.

* Change code on the Develop branch & commit

* verify the pipeline to see the new automatic trigger on Develop Pipeline

* Verify the changes on the application URL

* You can verify the Production application URL (master) as well, it will be still having the old code update only
